/// @author RJ Ewing<rj@rjewing.com>
/// @notice The BridgedMilestone contract is a plugin contract for liquidPledging,
///  extending the functionality of a liquidPledging project. This contract
///  provides the following functionality:
///  
///  1. If reviewer is set:
///     1. Milestone must be in the Completed state to withdraw
///  2. If maxAmount is set:
///     1. Milestone will only accept funding upto the maxAmount
///     2. Only a single token is acceppted
///  3. Checks that the donation is an acceptedToken
///     1. Can be set to ANY_TOKEN
///     2. Or a single token
///  4. Upon disbursement/withdrawal, the funds will be sent to the
///     ForeignGivethBridge contract and withdrawn to the corresponding
///     home network. Ending up in the recipient's account on the home
///     network
